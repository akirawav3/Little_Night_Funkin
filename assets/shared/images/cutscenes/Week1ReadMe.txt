Week 1 Cutscene Information : 
Font : amatic (In Assets/fonts)

All cutscene assets are in cutscenes folder

We use Kade 1.4.2 :)

Cutscene :
(I want it to open with the background, and the bubble to slowly come into frame, with no sprite yet)

? : How long has it been?...
Oh my head, geez...

Glitch Six (uses the Glitch Six animation) : It's been a while actually..
Surprised you're still alive.. Mono.

Mono (worry expression) : Six..? Wait.. You.
Mono (rage expression) : You let go.. Why, why did you do that?! 
I helped you through everything.. Didn't I?

Glitch Six (still uses animation) : Yes, you did. But that's not the point right now.
This is a different world, unlike yours, you and your Six, are here.

Mono (worry expression) : My.. Six? Aren't you my Six?

Glitch Six : No, afraid not. But this is where I depart, farewell and goodluck.. 
You'll need it..

(Background goes away, and you go to the first stage, and another cutscene happens between Six and Mono)

Six (Smile expression) : Hey! You're finally awake, it's uh.. Been a while.. I didn't expect to see you here.. or.. anywhere for that matter.

Mono (Angry expression) : ...

Six (Frown expression) : I can tell you're, still upset with me. I'm... sorry. I don't know what came over me.. Even after everything, with what I did to.. everyone else..

Mono (Worry expression) : ..?

Six (Frown expression) : But.. It's over now, I suppose. Now we're here so.. Maybe we get another shot, wanna go through this again with me?

Mono (Worry expression) : *sigh...* Fine, I trust you. 

Six (Smile expression) : Thank you...

Mono (Idle expression) : Sure but..
Mono (Dumbfounded expression) : What are these.. Little radio things?

Six (Smile expression) : Oh ! Those are Microphones, you sing into them, while you were out I practiced a bit, wanna learn with me?

Mono (Blush expression) : O-Oh ! Okay !

Six (Blush expression) : Lets do this !

*Week1 begins, Stage 1 and Stage 2 play, and then theres another cutscene before Stage 3*

Mono (Fluster expression) : Wow ! That was actually oddly fun.. Have anymore?

Six (Blush expression) : As a matter of fact I do, I actually made one up.. Wanna hear it?

Mono (Blush expression) : Y-Yeah ! Play it for me !

Six (Smile expression) : Okay ! Here we go !

*Stage 3 plays, and afterwards the week ends*
